ngrampy is a python class for manipulating google (or similarly formatted) n-gram data. It provides a python class for very basic table manipulations such that operations on tables are mimiced by operations on the hard drive, with huge n-gram files that cannot be read into RAM. This takes a lot of hard drive time, but can handle arbitrary file sizes (5~20gb is typical). This is *not* optimized for speed, since these things take a long time anyways and are typically run once. 

NOTE: In general, you should use this library with 
 
   export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
 
so that you can handle utf-8 characters from google.

== INSTALLATION:
========================================================

Put this library somewhere--mine lives in /home/piantado/mit/Libraries/ngrampy/
	
Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to ngrampy/:
	
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/piantado/Desktop/mit/Libraries/ngrampy
	
You can put this into your .bashrc file to make it loaded automatically when you open a terminal. On ubuntu and most linux, this is:
	
	echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/piantado/Desktop/mit/Libraries/ngrampy' >> ~/.bashrc

You can also do
  
        echo 'export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8' >> ~/.bashrc
        
although this will change your default python encoding. 
	
And you should be ready to use the library
